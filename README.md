## Class Breakdown and OOP Principles
(Previous class breakdown information goes here...)

## Feature Requirements
- [ ] Main menu with options to enter 2 players or vs. computer.
- [ ] Human vs. human mode and human vs. computer mode.
- [ ] Declare the winner at the end of each game.

## Technical Requirements (HARD)
- [ ] Use classes to remove repetitive parts of code.
- [ ] Create an abstract Player class to manage the player's state.
- [ ] Use interfaces where necessary.
- [ ] Handle invalid user input.
- [ ] Utilize public, private, and static variables, methods, and members.
- [ ] Incorporate exception handling with try-catch blocks.
- [ ] Get standard input with Java using a Scanner.
- [ ] Use arrays or array lists to store game history.
- [ ] Add JavaDoc strings and proper comments.
- [ ] Use Java Optionals and Lambdas.

## Bonus Ideas
- [ ] Write automated JUnit tests for your application.
- [ ] Use an Agile project management framework.
- [ ] Implement a history feature to display previous game history.
- [ ] Use Java packages to modularize code.
- [ ] Use Maven to install external dependencies.
- [ ] Use generics on collections to store different data composed of different types.
- [ ] Use multithreading to handle concurrent requests.
